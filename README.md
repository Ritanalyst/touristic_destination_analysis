# Tourist Destination Analysis Project

## Project Overview

As an idea for my first project, I analyzed data to understand which tourist destinations are the most popular and why. Instead of focusing on the main attractions of a place, I selected sample cities and analyzed various aspects.

## Tools Used

- **MySQL**: Used for the data cleaning and modeling process.
- **Power BI**: Used to create the data visualization and present the findings.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project was generated by **ChatGPT**, an AI language model developed by OpenAI. It was created specifically for this project and may not reflect real-world data.

## Objective

The goal of this project was to analyze the factors influencing the popularity of tourist destinations, focusing on accommodation spending rather than just attractions, providing a different perspective on tourism analysis.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Follow the instructions in the `data_cleaning.sql` file to replicate the data cleaning process in MySQL.
3. Open the Power BI file to explore the visualizations created.

## Notes

- The data used in this project is synthetic and generated by ChatGPT.
- The analysis may not represent actual tourism trends but aims to provide insights based on the available dataset.
